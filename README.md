# TechNL-Bootcamp

Something for students to clone, to get familiar with git.

To clone this repository, you're going to want to try the following inside your terminal in PyCharm:

git clone https://github.com/roy-keyin/student_task_repo_1.git

After that, you can try running the two examples in there. To run the shell script, try:

chmod +x example.sh
./example.sh

You can also run my example fizzbuzz program from the command line by using:

python3 fizzbuzz.py

Give that a try now.

Please also open the code in the editor and take a look at the source code. Feel free to make any changes that you'd like.
